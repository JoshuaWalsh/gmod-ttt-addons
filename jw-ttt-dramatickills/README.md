By default, corpses in TTT have the same velocity that the player had at the moment of their death.

This addon applies the force of the killing blow to the ragdoll, making kills just a little bit more dramatic. The force is applied to the precise position of impact.

You can configure the strength of the effect using the `jw_dramatickills_scale` server variable. For example, `jw_dramatickills_scale 0.5` will provide a more subtle effect.
