If you don't have a microphone, the hotkeys TTT provides for sending chat messages can be very useful. But it can be
difficult to use these hotkeys in the heat of the moment. Because sending a message requires pressing one of the number
keys, you will probably have to take your fingers off the WASD cluster in order to send one. And if you're standing,
you're a sitting duck for your enemies.

This addon adds an option to the TTT settings menu to change the radio hotkeys to a radial menu. You can use it by
holding down the radio (Suit Zoom) key and moving your mouse over one of the available messages. Release the radio
key to send the message.

Each player can choose whether they'd like to enable the radial behaviour or stick with the classic button-based radio.
